DESCRIPTION
    A toolkit to make working with Slurm Workload Manager a little bit easier.
    The stk script has a list of accepted commands which are entered after
    calling the main script. These commands form the bulk of the toolkit.

SYNOPSIS
       slurmtk <command> [<args>...]

AVAILABLE COMMANDS
    check
            Lists all jobs by the current user (as defined in the $USER special
            variable in most shells). The output is equivalent to the command:
            squeue -o "%.8i %.9P %.5u %.10T %.5C %.11L %j" -u $USER
    clear
            Clears the queue of jobs which were made by the current user (as
            defined in the $USER special variable in most shells).
    delbyname
            Usage: slurmtk delbyname <'Perl-style regex'>
            E.G.:  slurmtk delbyname 'md5sum'

            Searches the queue for jobs made by $USER, and keeps the names.
            Checks job names against a Perl-style regex, then feeds matching
            jobs into scancel.
    watch
            Clears the terminal window, and lists all jobs by the current
            user (as defined in the $USER special variable in most shells). The 
            output is the same as that of the 'check' command. The time is also
            displayed at the top of the screen. This screen refreshes every 120
            seconds until the user kills it with 'Ctrl+C'.
